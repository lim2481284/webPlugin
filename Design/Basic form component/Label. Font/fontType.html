Like when you’re reading a manuscript, most of the time, its on a yellow (ocher)-ish background. When you’re reading stuff related to food, you’re going to find a lot of red color use. That’s because the color read triggers the brain cells that relate to food. For example, Burger King, KFC, McDonald’s – they all have the color red in common.</p>
